# Creat the Need It Application

> ServiceNow's powerful platform allows developers to create cloud-native applications to rapidly add value to their organization. Developers can quickly create powerful applications using our Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a rich set of preâ€‘built services and templates. Also, because all applications are on our Platform, integrating with other ServiceNow applications is a breeze.

## Designing an Application

Take time to design the application before building the application. Although the application strategy or requirements might change during development, it is more efficient to start with a well-defined plan.

At a minimum, plan the following:

- Business Logic
- User Interface (UI)
- Data Model

###### Business Logic
Be able to clearly state the business problem to be solved and the desired outcomes. For example, the business problem statement(s) may start with:

We need to track...
We need to automate...
We need to respond...
Your outcome statement(s) may start with:

We can save...
We can retire...
We can improve...
Be able to list all stakeholders for your application. Use this information to design user personas which are important when applying security to an application.

Clearly define the business process that will be part of the application. List the required steps, stakeholders, data sources, and outputs/visualizations.

###### User Interface
Decide what User Interfaces (UIs) you will use within your application. There are a variety of strategies in ServiceNow. Users' skill sets and requirements are part of the UI selection.

Decide if the application is for desktop and tablet only, or if users can access the application from a smartphone.

###### Data Model
Determine the data model for the application. Define the table structure the application will use as well as the relationships between the tables. Typically tables are the first artifact added to an application. Changing the data model during the application development process can cause extensive re-working of an application's logic.
