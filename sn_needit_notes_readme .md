## Designing an Application

Take time to design the application before building the application. Although the application strategy or requirements might change during development, it is more efficient to start with a well-defined plan.

At a minimum, plan the following:

- Business Logic
- User Interface (UI)
- Data Model

###### Business Logic
Be able to clearly state the business problem to be solved and the desired outcomes. For example, the business problem statement(s) may start with:

We need to track...
We need to automate...
We need to respond...
Your outcome statement(s) may start with:

We can save...
We can retire...
We can improve...
Be able to list all stakeholders for your application. Use this information to design user personas which are important when applying security to an application.

Clearly define the business process that will be part of the application. List the required steps, stakeholders, data sources, and outputs/visualizations.

###### User Interface
Decide what User Interfaces (UIs) you will use within your application. There are a variety of strategies in ServiceNow. Users' skill sets and requirements are part of the UI selection.

Decide if the application is for desktop and tablet only, or if users can access the application from a smartphone.

###### Data Model
Determine the data model for the application. Define the table structure the application will use as well as the relationships between the tables. Typically tables are the first artifact added to an application. Changing the data model during the application development process can cause extensive re-working of an application's logic.


## Business Problem
Service Requests for Human Resources, Facilities, Legal, and other departments have been managed by email, spreadsheets, and personal contact making them hard to track and report on. Requests have even gone unfilled and employees are dissatisfied with the process and outcomes. Mismanaging service requests has been very expensive for the company.

The NeedIt application will manage and track requests for Human Resources, Legal, Facilities, and one other department (to be determined) in an automated way, using an easy to use user interface that is consistent with other corporate software.

## Desired Outcomes
- A single location where employees can submit service requests for Human Resources, Legal, Facilities, and other departments.
- Accurate and timely completion of all tasks necessary to fulfill service requests; fewer missed deadlines.
- Retire the spreadsheets currently used to manage requests.
- Improve requestor satisfaction with process and request fulfillment.
- Automation of as many steps as possible.


## Application Scope

Applications created in Studio are known as scoped applications. Scope uniquely identifies every application file, not just within a single ServiceNow instance, but in every instance around the world. Why is this important?

- Scope protects an application, its files, and its data from conflicts with other applications.
- Scope determines which parts of an application are available for use by other applications in ServiceNow.
- Scope allows developers to configure which parts of their application can be acted on by other applications.
- Scope prevents work done in the main ServiceNow browser window (not in Studio) from becoming part of an application's files.

###### How is Scope Set?

Scope value is set automatically by ServiceNow when an application is created in Studio. Scope is constructed by concatenating 3 values:

- x_
- <value from the glide.appcreator.company.code system property>_
- <first_10_characters_of_app_name>
All scope values start with x_.

The glide.appcreator.company.code system property is a unique, two to five character value which ServiceNow sets to identify a company's instances as belonging to the same company. Your Personal Developer Instance (PDI) has a numerical glide.appcreator.company.code value, for example 27266.

The entire scope value cannot be longer than 18 characters.

If you create an application called Custom Robots on your PDI, the scope would be similar to:

x_27266_custom_rob

###### How Do I Know What Scope I am Working In?

When developing an application in Studio, the scope is automatically set to the application under development.

When working in a non-Studio ServiceNow window, be aware of which scope is active. ServiceNow warns you if you attempt to work on artifacts outside of the current scope.

In the example, a developer is attempting to modify the Incident list. The Incident application is a baseline ServiceNow application, which is part of the Global scope. The current scope is for the Custom Robots application, which means that an application file from the Incident application is out of scope. To resolve the problem, select a link in the warning message. Which link to select is determined by the use case.

To easily see which scope is the current scope without having to wait for a warning message, add the Application Picker to the ServiceNow Banner.

- In the main ServiceNow browser window, click the Settings icon (The settings icon is the rightmost icon in the ServiceNow banner.) in the ServiceNow Banner.
- Select the Developer pane.
- Enable the Show application picker in header option:
- Close Settings
- The Application Picker displays the name of the current application. If needed, use the Application Picker to change scope.


## Creating an Application

Use Studio to create applications. The process for creating an application is:

- Launch Studio.
- Click the Create Application button.
- Name and describe the application.
- Open the newly created application for editing in Studio or proceed through the Guided App Creator wizard.
The following example demonstrates the process for creating an application and opening it in Studio for editing. For details about Guided App Creator, refer to the Guided App Creator and ServiceNow Studio module within the Build My First Application course.

To launch Studio, use the Application Navigator to open System Applications > Studio.

Studio opens in a new browser tab and the Select Application dialog opens.

Click the Create Application button. Guided App Creator opens in a dialog. The Guided App Creator Welcome screen is shown if it is your first time opening Guided App Creator. Click the Let's get started button. If it is not your first time, you will see the General Info pane.

 NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, you may only be able to work in the legacy application creator. If you are using Safari, you need version 12 or later to use Guided App Creator. To work in Guided App Creator, use a different browser.

- Name: application name
- Description: description of the application
- Drag and drop or browse to upload logo: image for the application
- Scoped/Global: scope for the application
- Scope: unique identifier for the application

Click the Create button.

Click the Continue in Studio (Advanced) link to open the Select Application dialog.

Click the Hello World link to open the new application.

The new application is loaded in Studio for development to begin. There are no default application files.

Configure the new application in the General Info pane.


## Exercise: Create the Delete Me Application


In this exercise, you will use Studio and Guided App Creator to create and delete the Delete Me application.


###### Create the Delete Me Application

- In the main ServiceNow browser window, use the Application Navigator to open System Applications > Studio.

- In the Select Application dialog, click the Create Application button.

- If you see the Guided App Creator Welcome screen, click the Let's get started button.

- Configure the application.

    Name:Delete Me
    Description: Temporary App

- Note the Scope value and its syntax. You do not need to do anything with this value, but it is important to understand for application file naming.

- Click the Create button.

- Click the Continue in Studio (Advanced) link to open the Select Application dialog.

- Click the Delete Me link to open the application in Studio for editing.

###### Delete the Delete Me Application
Delete the Delete Me application from the Application Settings record.

- In Studio, click the File menu and select the Settings menu item.

- Click the Delete button.

-In the Confirmation dialog, click the Delete button to confirm that you want to delete the application.

- When prompted, type the word delete into the dialog, then click the OK button.

- In the Progress dialog, click the Done button.

- Close the Studio browser tab.



## Importing an Application from Source Control

Studio integrates with GitHub repositories to manage source control for the application development process. Use any GitHub repository that is reachable using a https URL and a user account. Applications can be linked to source control after development has started. In the example below, the source code for an application that is under development exists in a GitHub repository. The application is imported into Studio from the GitHub repository.

The process for importing an application from source control is:

- Open Studio.
- Click the Import From Source Control button.
- Configure the connection to the GitHub repository and import.
- Open the imported application for editing in Studio.

The following example demonstrates the process for creating an application from source control.

Launch Studio by opening System Applications > Studio in the Application Navigator.

Studio opens in a new browser tab and displays the Select Application dialog.

Click the Import From Source Control button, then configure the connection to the source control repository. You must provide an https URL and valid credentials.

Click the Import button. A progress dialog appears. When the application import is completed, click the Select Application button.

In the Select Application dialog, click the link to the new application to open it for editing in Studio.




## Tables

After creating an application in Studio, the next step is to start the development work. Typically, but not required, the first application files to be developed are the application tables. For each application table, a decision must be made on whether or not to extend an existing table.

###### Extend a Table
Extending an existing ServiceNow table means the new table inherits the parent table's columns as well as its business logic. The most commonly extended table is the Task table.

Follow these steps to view the columns in a table:

- In the main ServiceNow Browser window, use the Application Navigator to open System Definition > Tables.
- Click a table in the list, such as Task, to open it for viewing.
- Scroll to the Columns section and examine the table's columns.
- Follow these steps to view the database schema for a table:

Scroll to the Related Links section and select the Show Schema Map link.
Examine the schema to see the relationships between the selected table and other tables in the database.

Follow these steps to view the business logic for a table:

- In the main ServiceNow browser window, enter task.list in the Application Navigator Filter navigator field to open the list of records for the Task table.
- Click a table record to open it for editing.
- Click the Additional actions menu (Additional actions menu) and select the Configure > All menu item.
- Select each of the tabs to examine the existing business logic for the table.

Create a Table Without Extending Another Table
Creating a table without extending an existing table means that the application developer has complete control over the table's columns and business logic. This type of table is often used for tables containing reference/lookup data. For example, a flight tracking application may have a table that contains airport locations and airport codes.

ServiceNow adds 6 fields to all tables, including those that do not extend an existing table:

- Created by
- Created
- Sys ID
- Updates
- Updated by
- Updated

###### Deciding Whether to Extend a Table
The decision of whether or not to extend an existing table depends on the requirements of the application. When deciding whether or not to extend a table, take the following into consideration:

After the table development strategy is finalized, begin developing the application files in Studio.


## Using Studio

Use Studio to edit applications and application files. There are four components of the Studio user interface:

- Header
- Application Explorer
- Content Frame
- Status Bar

###### Header
The Header contains the name of the logged in user, menus, and code search.

###### Application Explorer
The Application Explorer contains a list of application files organized by category. Select an application file in the Application Explorer to open the file for viewing or editing in the Content Frame.

###### Content Frame
The Content Frame displays the form for each record in an application file. The appearance and content of the form varies with file type. Each record appears in its own tab. A dot on a tab indicates unsaved changes.

###### Status Bar
The Status Bar contains the application name, application version, number of files comprising the application, and the source control integration.



## Adding a File

The procedure for adding files to an application is the same regardless of file type:

- Click the Create Application File link.
- Choose the new file type.
- Configure the new file.
- The following example creates a Table.

To add an application artifact to an application, select the Create Application File button in Studio. The Create Application File dialog opens.

Use the Search field to locate the application file type of your choice, or browse the categories. Notice that the Table application file type is part of the Data Model category.

Select the application file type then click the Create button.

The new application file opens in a new tab in Studio.

Configure the file options. Fields preceded by an asterisk are required.

- *Label: Friendly name of the new table.
- *Name: Name of the table in the database. Automatically created.
- Extends table: The table to extend. When extending a table, the new table inherits all columns from the parent table. Leave this field blank if you are not extending a table. Tables that do not extend an existing table will automatically contain six default fields.
- Application: The application (scope) this table belongs to (read-only field).
- Create module: Select to add a menu option to the application.
- Create mobile module: Select to add a menu option to the mobile application menu.
- Add module to menu: Select or create a new application menu to add the module to. The default is to create a new application menu.
- New menu name: Appears when -- Create new -- is selected in the Add module to menu field. Specifies the application menu to add the module to.

###### Columns Section

- A list of table columns.

###### Controls Section

- Extensible: Select this option if you intend for the table to be extended by tables in this or other applications.
- Live feed: Select to enable interactions between this table and the Live Feed application.
- Auto-number: When selected sets the prefix, starting number, and number of digits for the records from the table.
- *Create access controls: When selected, creates delete, write, read, and create permissions for table records. All scoped applications are required to create access controls for their tables.
User role: Sets the role required for a user to access the table's records.

###### Application Access Section

- Accessible from: Select the This application scope only option to provide complete runtime protection. Select the All application scopes option to allow access to any scope.
- Can read/create/update/delete: Select these options to allow scripts from other application scopes to perform these database operations on the application's tables. These options never apply to the current application's scope.
- Allow access to this table via web services: Allow scripts to make web services calls against the table. The user performing the query must have permissions to access the table.
- Allow configuration: Allows application developers working in other application scopes, to write scripts for this table.
